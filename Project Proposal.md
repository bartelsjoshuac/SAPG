## Reflection on teamwork:
#### The team is using Discord as a collaboration tool, which supports txt, voice, sharing, and video on both desktop and mobile platforms and will augment it with Zoom as needed.  The team needs to schedule meetings early in the week because of complex and conflicting schedules of full time day job student, and full time students with evening classes.  Because of the commitments with the instructor and limited availability of real time communications ,the agreed upon meeting times cannot be rescheduled to accommodate individuals.  All project work will be concluded by Sunday at 10pm, to allow all team members to start the following weeks activities with a blank plate.
